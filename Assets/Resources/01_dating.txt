I'm losing her. I'm losing her to Alec. I'm watching it happen. I'm split between "How dare she?" and "Why would she stay with me? Why would anyone?"

I made pancakes for her this morning. And Alec. They let me stay on their couch. I'm still in love with her but it's over. I'm still in love with her and it's over. The pancakes will make a good story someday.

It took longer to finish my degree than I expected. I'm working at an auto body shop until I can get back into my field.

I saw her today at my little sister's move-in day at university. She's an RD in one of the residence halls. She's still dating Alec. She looked good.

She went on to further education. I went into the workforce. It was an amicable split, but we don't talk anymore.

Before you asked me, I hadn't thought about her in a long time. I loved her, but I don't miss her like I used to.
