I'm losing her. I've been losing her. I'm losing her to Alec. I'm watching it happen. I waver between "How could she?" and "Why would she stay with me? Why would anyone?"

I made pancakes for her. And Alec. They let me stay on their couch. I'm still in love with her but it's over. I love her <i><b>and</b></i> it's over. The pancakes will make a good story someday.

It's taking longer to finish my degree than I expected. My field was booming a few years ago, but it's slumping now. I got a job at an auto repair shop.

I saw her today while moving my sister into university. She's an RD in one of the residence halls. She's still dating Alec. She looked good.

She went on to higher ed. I found a proper job. We don't talk anymore.

Before you asked me, I hadn't thought about her in a long time. I loved her once, but I don't miss her like I used to.
