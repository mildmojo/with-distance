I woke up in the hospital. My thumbs hurt. I think they were hooked into the steering wheel. I don't remember what happened. Where's Dani?

The police called, and I... she's at Niagara Memorial. Dani was in an accident and she's unconscious. I don't know. We have to leave. Now.

Hey, Dani and Soraya were supposed to get home this morning, right? Did she text you? I just saw a thing about an accident in Buffalo. Are they okay?

@FranziDotes 5m\nSTAY OFF 90W this AM. Massive pileup at exit 49 due to ice & fog. Google says 45-min delay.

For fuck's sake, we haven't moved in 45 minutes. This is a parking lot. Unreal. I left TWO HOURS EARLY, and I'm still going to miss my fucking flight.
